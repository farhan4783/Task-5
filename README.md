# Task-5
Objective

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to extract meaningful insights using statistical and visual methods.

Tools Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook


Dataset

The dataset used is the Titanic Dataset from Kaggle or any other public source. It contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, such as:

Age, Sex, Pclass, Fare

Survival status (Survived or not)

Family size, Embarked port, etc.


EDA Techniques Applied

.info(), .describe(), .value_counts() for data inspection

Null value detection and handling

Univariate and Bivariate analysis

Histograms, Boxplots, Scatterplots, Countplots

Pairplots and Heatmaps to study correlations

Observations documented for each visual


Key Insights

Younger passengers and females had higher survival rates.

First-class passengers were more likely to survive.

Fare and survival showed a positive correlation.

Missing values were mostly in the Age and Cabin columns.


Deliverables

Titanic_EDA.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing full analysis with code and visuals

Titanic_EDA_Report.pdf – PDF summary of findings and key visualizations
